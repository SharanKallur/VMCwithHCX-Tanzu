# Lab Guide Day 2

# Introduction
This second part of this workshop is dedicated to the App Modernization topic and relies mainly on VMware Tanzu, our container management solution which is now also available on VMware Cloud on AWS as you will see during labs.

You will use user on jumpbox call grease-monkey. One user per group, suggested app has been extracted and based on one running on previous front-end VM. So, the main purpose
is to run 2 distinct pods instead of a VM: nginx + phpfm. The intend to do that is to leverage k8s capabilities to easyly scale application depending on number of request.
