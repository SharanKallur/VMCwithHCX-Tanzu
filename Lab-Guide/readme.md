# Introduction

The VMC with Tanzu Experience Day (VMCwithTanzu)workshop is an opportunity to test this unique combination of services that will help you to accelerate your app modernization. This workshop in based on a classroom model with VMware Cloud on AWS and Tanzu experts who support you during hands on lab exercises to understand and gain experience with these VMware Cloud services.

This Experience day is split into 2 sessions where we will discover VMware Cloud on AWS interface more generally and then have a look on the Lab prepared for you: what is the application, environment, and so on.

Once these environments have been covered we'll start hands on with workload migration into VMware Cloud on AWS, by leveraguing its unique capabilities : live migration, no RE-IP with a still functioning application while migrating.
Once done, we will see how the front-end, migrated into the Cloud can still communicate with back-end VM still in the source environment.

Finally we will continue with the Modern app part of this workshop by activating and leveraging Tanzu, our Kubernetes service included into VMC to transform our current application based on VMs into containers. We will finally configure integration with AWS Services to see how easy it is to access to hundred of services to spice up your apps!

Enjoy!


# Lab Environment introduction
2 different environments at your disposal both hosted on VMware Cloud on AWS, where first will act as the source datacenter, the second will be the target where we will migrate workloads to modernize an application.
VMware team will provide all details about these environments (names, URLs, IP addresses...), please keep it or feel free ask to ask if not received.
